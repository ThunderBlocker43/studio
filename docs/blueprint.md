## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#4285F4) to evoke trust and stability, while feeling modern. Chosen because blue is often associated with technology and reliability.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#F4F7FA) to provide a clean and unobtrusive backdrop for listings. It is of a similar hue as the primary, but desaturated.
- Accent color: A slightly more vibrant shade of green-blue (#34A853). Its analogous placement provides visual interest, and this specific value offers the right contrast and emphasis on important action items.
- Headline font: 'IBM Plex Sans', a proportional sans-serif for headlines.
- Body font: 'IBM Plex Sans', a grotesque-style sans-serif.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent listing features and filters.
- Prioritize a clean, grid-based layout for easy browsing and comparison of listings.
